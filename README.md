# Automatic Speech Recognition with AudioMNIST
Final project for deep learning
## Abstract
For this project, I trained the a convolutional neural network to classify digits spoken in the AudioMNIST dataset. The result was 45% accuracy after 20 epochs, which could easily be improved by training for more epochs.
